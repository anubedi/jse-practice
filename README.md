Basic syntax of java

1.Class
2.Object
3.variables(static,instance,local varible)
4.method
5.Datatypes(int,float,double,String,long)
int =0
flaot =0.f
double =0
String =null;
long =0
Wraper(Integer,Double etc)--> default value null
6.identifiers(A to Z a to z _,$)
7.access specifiers(public,protected,private ,default)
non access specifiers(abstract,final,strictft)
8.java arrays
9.Enum


8.detailed discussion on object and class

//setter and getters
//constructor


1.when the instance varaible will load.

while creating the object
how many ways are there to set data to an onbject

1.setter method

2.constructor

when we will go for constructor --> if the value is manadatory;
when we will go for setter  --> if the value is optional


control statements in java.

1.if else
2.switch block
3.while
4.do while
5.for loop
6.break
7.continue
6.java comments

write a program to find given number is either odd or even

write a program to give odd nmubers and even numbers in first 10 number using for loop

write a program to give odd nmubers and even numbers in first 10 number using while loop

1 to 5

1 bad
2 aveage

3 good

4.excellent

write a program to verify whether given number is prime number or not

write a program to find prime numbers between 1 to 20

2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19

OOPS:
----------------
1.what is class(just blue print of an object)

class has physical entity

what is an object

state
action

1.inheritance(reusability,parent(super),subclass(this))


what is diffrence between and this and super


how to load/access instance variables
by cteating object



Employee
id,name,dept,salary,account,salary

admin(acess,departments)
devloper(skill type,designation)
tester(skill type , designation)


1.inheritance

is a relation /has a relation

2.encapusation(abstraction,intreface,package access specifiers,access modifiers)
data hiding

3.polymorphism(method overriding,method overloading)

static class,static method, static block, static varibale


data hiding(permissions)
Access specifiers
public (which can access across the project)
protected(with in the package,super class and its subclass)
private(with in the class)
default(which load implistly)


abstract class can contains both concrete method and abstract method

concrete method : a method which contains a body(having the implementation and definition)

abstarct method a method which don't have any body(only the definition and don't have implementation)

what is an interface ?

interface is class which contains only abstarct methods

Notification

1.intreface with factory design pattern


1.what are the preacutiions you need to take to override a method

1.that ovverrided method should be extend/implement the super class

2.mehod definition and signature should be same as super class method


Strings,Arrays

String handlers
1.what is a string

2.what is stringbuffer

2.what is Stringbuilder

3.what is String pooling

String is immutable

== ,equals

concat,split,substring


String s1= "pavan";
String s2 = new String("pavan");

concatenation,split,substring,index,suffix,prefix

    chandu   





Strring s1 = "d/chandu/abc.xml"

Strring s2= "d/chandu/abc.pdf"


String s3= "d/chandu/abc.txt

String s1= "d/chandu/abc/abc.xml";


String s1="west side counter";

String s1="east side counter";

String s1="chandu is java programmerr";


String s1="pavan is plm programmer";
